            <p>Curiosity is taking daily weather measurements at Gale Crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars, near the equator. At this location, it's currently late autumn.

			The term sol is used to refer to the duration of a day on Mars. A sol is about 24 hours and 40 minutes. For Curiosity,
			sol 0 corresponds with its landing day on Mars.

           <div class="show-mars-info ">        
				The duration of a Martian day (sol) is about 24 hours and 40 minutes. The duration
				of daylight varies along the Martian year, as on Earth.

            <div class="show-mars-info">
				Mars is farther from the Sun than Earth, it makes that Mars is colder than our planet.
				Moreover, Martian's atmosphere, which is extremely tenuous, does not retain the heat; 
				hence the difference between day and night's temperatures is more pronounced than in our planet.	
            </div>

            <div class="show-mars-info">
			One day on Earth is about 24 hours, while a sol (Martian day) is about 24 hours and 40 minutes.
			So one single sol starts during one Earth day and finishes during the next Earth day. This 
			is the Earth day on current sol at midday.
            </div>

				NASA Viking landers and NASA Pathfinder rover showed that the average wind speed
				on their location was pretty weak: 1 to 4 meters/second (4 to 15 kilometers/hour - 
				2.5 to 9 miles/hour). However, during a dust storm, winds can reach 30 meters/second 
				(110 kilometers/hour - 68 miles/hour) or more.

            <div class="show-mars-info">
            
				Weather on Mars is more extreme than Earth's. Mars is cooler and with
				bigger differences between day and night temperatures. Moreover, 
				dust storms lash its surface. However, Mars' and Earth's climates have
				important similarities, such as the polar ice caps or seasonal changes.
				As on Earth, on Mars we can have sunny, cloudy or windy days, for example.
			 
            </div>
            <div class="show-mars-info">
				Martian's atmosphere is extremely tenuous, about 160 times thinner than Earth's,
				so heat from the Sun can easily escape. It makes that there are big differences
				between ground temperature and air temperature. Imagine you were on the Martian equator 
				at noon, you would feel like summer at your feet, but winter in your head.
